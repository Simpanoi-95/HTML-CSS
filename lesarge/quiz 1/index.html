<h1>THIS IS MY STORY</h1>
<p> 
Luisa (identity protected) shares a three-roomed apartment with her mother, step-father and 9 other family members. Her step-father lost his job in construction in 2007 and her mom has been unable to find any lasting work. The family relies on a soup kitchen for food and donations of clothing from neighbors.

<p>
One day my friend saw me at the soup kitchen and since then my friends donâ€™t talk to me anymore and treat me like someone who is in need.

What I would like in the future is to change the world, to do what I can to help people, to help the poor and give them what they need. Everybody will have a stable house. Everybody will be well and nobody will be in need.
