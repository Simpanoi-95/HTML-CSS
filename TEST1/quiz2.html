<h3>How can we visualise beyond what we see and currently experience. Use insights from the books and discussions we have had in class.</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
What we currently see and experience in our daily life usually determines how see our future.
 We can visualize by:
 <br>
                                   <li>
                                        EXPOSURE  
What happens in our mind at one time is because it is stored. It has already happened to you. You can visualize things that have happened to you .sometimes expose yourself to the outside world and create a more detailed and realistic visual simulation in your mind.
For example if you want to do something, you don’t have any experience doing it. So you will need to expose yourself and anything that exposes you and increases your knowledge.
An example in our book where women in the book Challenging Patriarchy took a step and involved themselves in liberation movements and sought to secure independence in various ways.</li><br>
                                         
                             <li> 
                             	 HEARING FROM OTHERS
From the Trevor Noah’s story, we tend to imagine the life he went through with the mother when he tells us the story.so hearing his part of the story without being there makes us imagine how everything went like .so from that story we can visualize what we see right now and in the future about families and how their life’s are.

In the book Mans Search for meaning ,we get to understand how man can visualize the life he/she is living now and the life he/she would like to live in the future . The life he/she living is not life he /she wants to live in the future.</li><br>
                     
                                           

                            <li> 
                                  PICTURE/DESCRIBE
  The more details you have while visualizing, is the more real it will become to you. for example when you want something , you sit and visualize about it and that increase your drive of wanting it .That helps you develop a plan .So the best way to  create details is to picture it an describe it yourself .if you want it to feel real, keep adding more information until it feels real.<br>
